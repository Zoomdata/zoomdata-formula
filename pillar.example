### The Zoomdata provisioning configuration example file
### ====================================================
###
### This is Salt Pillar file written in SaltStack's (SLS) format:
### a tree-like data structure in YAML rendered with Jinja2 templating engine.
### https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/pillar.html
### https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/yaml/
### https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/jinja/
###
### It has default values for latest Generally Available Zoomdata release.
### The settings for the last Long Term Supported release are coded within the
### formula in the ``zoomdata/defaults.yaml`` file, which applies out of the
### box unless redefined in the Pillar file.
